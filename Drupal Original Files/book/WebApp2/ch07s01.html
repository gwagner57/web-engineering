We assume that any club member may chair or co-chair at most one committee (where the disjunction is non-exclusive). So, we get the following model:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resources/CommitteeChairAndCochair_AFM1.png"></div><p>Notice that there is a close correspondence between the two reference properties <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code> and <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code>. They are the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">inverse</span></strong></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e2644"></a> of each other: when the club member Tom is the chair of the budget committee, expressed by the tuple <span class="italic">("budget committee", "Tom")</span>, then the budget committee is the committee chaired by the club member Tom, expressed by the inverse tuple <span class="italic">("Tom", "budget committee")</span>. For expressing this inverse correspondence in the diagram, we append an inverse property constraint, <code class="code">inverse of chair</code>, in curly braces to the declaration of the property <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code>, and a similar one to the property <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code>, as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resources/CommitteeChairAndCochair_AFM2.png"></div><p>Using the reference path notation of OOP languages, with <span class="italic">c</span> referencing a <code class="code">Committee</code> object, we obtain the equation:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d5e2660"></a><div class="equation-title">Equation&nbsp;7.1.&nbsp;</div><div class="equation-contents"><span class="mathphrase">c.chair.chairedCommittee = c</span></div></div><p>Or, the other way around, with <span class="italic">m</span> referencing a <code class="code">ClubMember</code> object, we obtain the equation:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d5e2665"></a><div class="equation-title">Equation&nbsp;7.2.&nbsp;</div><div class="equation-contents"><span class="mathphrase">m.chairedCommittee.chair = m</span></div></div><p>Notice that when a property <span class="italic">p<sub>2</sub></span> is the inverse of a property <span class="italic">p<sub>1</sub></span>, this implies that, the other way around, <span class="italic">p<sub>1</sub></span> is the inverse of <span class="italic">p<sub>2</sub></span>. Therefore, when we declare the property <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code> to be the inverse of <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code>, then, implicitly, <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code> is the inverse of <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code>. We therefore call <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code> and <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code> a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">pair of mutually inverse reference properties</span></strong></span>. Having such a pair in a model implies <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">redundancy</span></strong></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e2692"></a> because each of the two involved reference properties can be derived from the other by inversion. This type of redundancy implies <span class="italic">data storage overhead</span> and <span class="italic">update overhead</span>, which is the price to pay for the bidirectional navigability<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2696"></a> that supports efficient object access in both directions.</p><p>For maintaining the duplicate information of a mutually inverse reference property pair, it is common to treat one of the two involved properties as the <span class="italic">master</span>, and the other one as the <span class="italic">slave</span>, and take this distinction into consideration in the code of the change methods (such as the property setters) of the affected model classes. We indicate the slave of an inverse reference property pair in a model diagram by declaring the slave property to be a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">derived</span></strong></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e2704"></a> property using the UML notation of a slash (<code class="code">/</code>) as a prefix of the property name as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resources/CommitteeChairAndCochair_AFM3.png"></div><p>The property <code class="code">chairedCommittee</code> in <code class="code">ClubMember</code> is now <span class="italic">derived</span> (as indicated by its slash prefix). Its annotation <code class="code">{inverse of chair}</code> defines a <span class="italic">derivation rule</span> according to which it is derived by inverting the property <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code>.</p><p>In a UML class diagram, the derivation of a property can be specified by an OCL <span class="italic">derive</span> expression that evaluates to the value of the derived property for a given object. In the case of a property being the inverse of another property, specified by the constraint expression <code class="code">{inverse of</code> <span class="italic">anotherProperty</span><code class="code">}</code> appended to the property declaration, the derivation expression is implied. In our example, for any club member object <code class="code">m</code>, it evaluates to the committee object <code class="code">c</code> such that <code class="code">c.chair = m</code>. In OCL, this derivation rule would be expressed like so</p><pre class="programlisting">context ClubMember::chairedCommittee: Committee
derive:
  if Committee.allInstancea().exists( c | c.chair = self) then c</pre><p>There are two ways how to realize the derivation of a property: it may be <span class="italic">derived on read</span> via a read-time computation of its value, or it may be <span class="italic">derived on update</span> via an update-time computation performed whenever one of the variables in the derivation expression (typically, another property) changes its value. The latter case corresponds to a <span class="italic">materialized view</span> in a database. While a reference property that is derived on read may not guarantee efficient navigation, because the on-read computation may create unacceptable latencies, a reference property that is derived on update does provide efficient navigation.</p><p>When we designate an inverse reference property as derived by prefixing its name with a slash (<code class="code">/</code>), we indicate that it is derived on update. For instance, the property <code class="code">/chairedCommittee</code> in the example above is derived on update from the property <code class="code">chair</code>.</p><p>In the case of a derived reference property, we have to deal with <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">life-cycle dependencies</span></strong></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e2739"></a> between the affected model classes requiring special change management mechanisms based on the functionality type of the represented association (either <span class="italic">one-to-one</span>, <span class="italic">many-to-one</span> or <span class="italic">many-to-many</span>).</p><p>In our example of the derived inverse reference property <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code>, which is single-valued and optional, this means that</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>whenever a new committee object is created (with a mandatory <code class="code">chair</code> assignment), the corresponding <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code> property has to be assigned accordingly;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>whenever the <code class="code">chair</code> property is updated (that is, a new chair is assigned to a committee), the corresponding <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code> property has to be unset for the club member who was the previous chair and set for the one being the new chair;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>whenever a committee object is destroyed, the corresponding <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code> property has to be unset.</p></li></ol></div><p>In the case of a derived inverse reference property that is multi-valued while its inverse base property is single-valued (like <code class="code">Publisher</code>::<code class="code">publishedBooks</code> in Figure <a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#figBidirAFM" title="Figure&nbsp;7.4.&nbsp;The OO class model with two pairs of mutually inverse reference properties">7.4</a> below being derived from <code class="code">Book</code>::<code class="code">publisher</code>), the life cycle dependencies imply that</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>whenever a new 'base object' (such as a book) is created, the corresponding inverse property has to be updated by adding a reference to the new base object to its value set (like adding a reference to the new book object to <code class="code">Publisher</code>::<code class="code">publishedBooks</code>);</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>whenever the base property is updated (e.g., a new publisher is assigned to a book), the corresponding inverse property (in our example, <code class="code">Publisher</code>::<code class="code">publishedBooks</code>) has to be updated as well by removing the old object reference from its value set and adding the new one;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>whenever a base object (such as a book) is destroyed, the corresponding inverse property has to be updated by removing the reference to the base object from its value set (like removing a reference to the book object to be destroyed from <code class="code">Publisher</code>::<code class="code">publishedBooks</code> ).</p></li></ol></div><p>Notice that from a purely computational point of view, we are free to choose either of the two mutually inverse reference properties (like <code class="code">Book</code>::<code class="code">authors</code> and <code class="code">Author</code>::<code class="code">authoredBooks</code>) to be the master. However, in many cases, associations represent asymmetrical ontological existence dependencies that dictate which of the two mutually inverse reference properties is the master. For instance, the authorship association between the classes <code class="code">Book</code> and <code class="code">Author</code> represents an ontological existence dependency of books on their authors. A book existentially depends on its author(s), while an author does not existentially depend on any of her books. Consequently, the corresponding object lifecycle dependency between <code class="code">Book</code> and <code class="code">Author</code> implies that their bidirectional association is maintained by maintaining <code class="code">Author</code> references in <code class="code">Book</code>::<code class="code">authors</code> as the natural choice of master property, while <code class="code">Author</code>::<code class="code">authoredBooks</code> is the slave property, which is derived from <code class="code">Book</code>::<code class="code">authors</code>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch07.html"><img src="images/prev.svg" alt="Prev"></a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch07.html"><img src="images/up.svg" alt="Up"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch07s02.html"><img src="images/next.svg" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Bidirectional Associations&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html"><img src="images/home.svg" alt="Home"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Making an OO Class Model</td></tr></table></div></body>
