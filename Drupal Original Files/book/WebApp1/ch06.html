  need an architecture that helps master their complexity by breaking them
  down into smaller parts with manageable inter-dependencies. Software
  application architecture is concerned with the following issues:
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>The state structure of the application system to be designed is
        defined in the form of <span class="italic">information
        models</span> describing its <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">information architecture</span></strong></span>.
        <a class="indexterm" name="d5e4105"></a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The goal of a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">code base
       architecture</span></strong></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e4111"></a> is to structure and partition the overall program code of an application in such a
     way that the fundamental software quality goal of <span class="italic">maintainability</span> is achieved.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The distribution of the application system's runtime components
        within a computer network is defined by a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">deployment
        architecture</span></strong></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e4118"></a>. A web app is distributed on the Web, which is a
        world-wide client-server network system with HTTP-based
        communication.</p></li></ol></div><p>As in all cases of designing a complex system, no matter if a new
  building, a new space shuttle, a new computer or a new software application
  is to be designed, an architecture provides a kind of master plan for
  defining the structure of the system. Any good architecture is based on the
  following three principles:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">separation of
     concerns</span></strong></span>, which helps managing complexity by breaking a system down into
    smaller, functionally defined parts such that their</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">interdependencies
      are minimized</span></strong></span>,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>keeping the more fundamental parts independent of the less
      fundamental parts (the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">onion principle</span></strong></span>).<a class="indexterm" name="d5e4134"></a></p></li></ol></div><p>Complying with these principles makes it easier to develop, or source,
  and update certain system parts independently of others.</p><p>The three most important parts of the code base of an app are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">model</span></strong></span>, which implements the app's
      data model in the form of <span class="italic">model
      classes</span>, defining suitable data structures and
      constraints;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the data <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">storage</span></strong></span> management procedures, which
      set up a connection to a storage management system (typically, but not
      necessarily, an SQL database system) and use it for storing and
      retrieving persistent data;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">user
      interface</span></strong></span> (UI) code, taking care of both
      information provision (or output) to the user, e.g., on the computer
      screen, and user input provided by user actions in the form of UI
      events, e.g., keyboard or mouse events, such that all required user
      interactions are supported.</p></li></ol></div><p>The onion principle requires to keep the app's model classes
  independent of</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>the UI code because it should be possible to re-use the same model
      classes with different UI technologies;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the storage management code because it should be possible to
      re-use the same model classes with different storage
      technologies.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, in many web application frameworks (e.g., in Java EE) the
  onion principle is violated.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e4159"></a>1.&nbsp;The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture Metaphor</h2></div></div></div><p>The most popular and most widely used approach in software application architecture is the
    <span class="bold"><strong>M</strong></span>odel-<span class="bold"><strong>V</strong></span>iew-<span class="bold"><strong>C</strong></span>ontroller<a class="indexterm" name="d5e4165"></a> code partitioning pattern. Although it has not been precisely defined, and has been
   implemented in many different ways, especially in web application frameworks, it is based on the
   principle of <span class="italic">separation of concerns</span> and on the fundamental
   insight that the <span class="italic">model</span> is the foundation for all other parts
   of an application, in particular for the user interface. Consequently, even if the MVC<a class="indexterm" name="d5e4169"></a> approach doesn't provide a precise definition of what a 'model' is, we can consider
   it to be a <span class="italic">model-based</span> approach.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d5e4173"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp;The MVC code base architecture with the model as the

    application programming with <span class="italic">Smalltalk-76</span> by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug" target="_top">Trygve
    Reenskaug</a> in the 1970s. In a later <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100921030808/http://www.itu.dk/courses/VOP/E2005/VOP2005E/8_mvc_krasner_and_pope.pdf" target="_top">article
    about Smalltalk-80</a>, MVC is explained as a "three-way division of an
    application" that entails "separating (1) the parts that represent the
    model of the underlying application domain from (2) the way the model is
    presented to the user and from (3) the way the user interacts with it".
    The authors, who also use the term "MVC metaphor", point out that their
    approach would allow programmers to "write an application model by first
    defining new classes that would embody the special application
    domain-specific information".</p><p>Notice that the <span class="italic">model</span> is defined
    to consist of classes that capture the required domain information. We
    call them <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">model
    classes</span></strong></span>.</p><p>In this original MVC approach, there is no well-defined concept of a
    user interface (UI). The 'view' is defined as comprising the output side
    of a UI, only, while the user input side is separated from it and subsumed
    under the term 'controller'. This does not reflect how a UI is really
    organized: by combining certain forms of application output with certain
    forms of user input like two sides of the same coin. A general UI concept
    includes both the output (the information output provided to the user, as
    well as system actions) and the input (including information input
    provided, as well as actions performed, by the user).</p><p>The Smalltalk MVC metaphor was developed for (monochromatic)
    text-screen-based user interfaces with no general notion of UI events.
    This may explain why they did not consider an integral concept of a UI.
    While they distinguished between the state of objects in the model and
    their state in the UI, which are both in the scope of a user session, they
    did not consider the distinction between the model state and the database
    state.</p><p>In his web essay <a class="link" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html" target="_top">GUI
    Architectures</a> (2006), Martin Fowler summarizes the main principles
    of the original MVC approach in the following way:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Separation between UI and model.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Divide UI into a 'controller' and 'view'.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Views are synchronized with the model (by means of a data
          binding mechanism).</p></li></ol></div><p>While the first and third principles are fundamental for
    the architecture of software applications, the second principle has just a
    historic meaning and was soon abandoned by the developers of
    Smalltalk.</p><p>Compared to the 1980s, computers, human-computer interaction and
    software application architecture have evolved. In particular, the
    establishment of the Web as the predominant computing platform has made
    web browsers to be the most important infrastructure for user
    interfaces.</p><p>The MVC terminology is still widely used today, especially by web
    application frameworks, but with different meanings ascribed to "M", "V"
    and "C". Typically, the "view" denotes the app's code for the
    HTML-forms-based user interface, and the "controller" denotes the code
    that is in charge of mediating between the "view" and the "model".</p><p>In many MVC approaches, the "model" is tightly coupled with the
    underlying database technology, often via an <span class="italic">object-relational mapping</span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e4201"></a> (ORM<a class="indexterm" name="d5e4203"></a>) approach mapping classes to tables and objects to table
    rows. This tight coupling between model classes and database tables
    violates both the fundamental principle of minimizing interdependencies
    (because there is no need that model classes depend on database tables)
    and the onion principle discussed below.</p><p>For instance, in the <span class="italic"><a class="link" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html" target="_top">Active
    Record</a></span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e4209"></a> paradigm of the influential <span class="italic">Ruby-on-Rails</span> framework, which has been adopted
    by many other web application frameworks (such as by <span class="italic">CakePHP</span>), the "model" is a direct representation
    of the schema of the underlying database system, where each entity table
    of the database is represented by a "model" class that inherits data
    manipulation methods for performing Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete (CRUD)
    operations. In this table-to-model-class mapping approach, the "model"
    depends on the schema of the underlying database and is therefore tightly
    coupled with the underlying ORM technology. While this may be a suitable approach for a 
    <span class="italic">database-first</span> development methodology, where an
    SQL database is the foundation of an application, it is certainly not a
    general approach and it turns the <span class="italic">model</span>
    into a secondary asset.</p><p>Also in frameworks based on ORM annotations, such as <span class="italic">Java EE</span> with <span class="italic">JPA</span> annotations, the C# framework <span class="italic">ASP.NET MVC</span> with <span class="italic">Entity
    Framework</span> and <span class="italic">Data
    Annotations</span>, or the PHP framework <span class="italic">Symfony</span> with <span class="italic">Doctrine</span> annotations, the "model" is coupled with
    the underlying ORM technology through the ORM annotations woven into the
    model code, thus making the model dependent on the ORM technology used.
    All these frameworks use the <span class="italic"><a class="link" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html" target="_top">Data
    Mapper</a></span> approach for performing CRUD operations based on
    ORM annotations.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s06.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch06s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">6.&nbsp;Exercises&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The Onion Architecture Metaphor</td></tr></table></div></body>
