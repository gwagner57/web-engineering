    (<a class="link" href="http://www.uml.org/" target="_top">UML</a>), created in the
    mid-1990s, is an industry standard that defines a set of modeling
    languages for making various kinds of models and diagrams in support of
    object-oriented problem analysis and software design. Its core languages
    are <span class="italic">Class Diagrams</span> for information/data
    modeling, and <span class="italic">Sequence Diagrams</span>,
    <span class="italic">Activity Diagrams</span> and <span class="italic">State Diagrams</span> (or <span class="italic">State
    Charts</span>) for process/behavior modeling.</p></div><p>UML<a class="indexterm" name="d5e3597"></a> class diagrams provide a visual syntax for expressing
  UML<a class="indexterm" name="d5e3599"></a> class models, which allow defining information and data
  models. They can be used both at the more abstract level of <span class="italic">conceptual modeling</span> for requirements engineering
  and at the more detailed level of <span class="italic">design
  modeling</span> for designing the model classes of an app. Their main
  building blocks are <span class="italic">class rectangles</span> and
  <span class="italic">association lines</span>.</p><p>A <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">class</span></strong></span> rectangle has one, two or three
  compartments, containing the name of the class, its properties, and its
  methods. The purpose of a class is to classify objects and to define their
  properties and the methods that can be invoked on them.</p><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>RDF and OWL</b></p></div></div></div><p>The <span class="italic">Resource Description
    Framework</span> (<a class="link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/" target="_top">RDF</a>) has been
    defined by the W3C in 2004 as a logical formalism that allows (1)
    formalizing information models in the form of <span class="italic">RDF
    vocabularies</span>, and (2) representing <span class="italic">propositional information</span> (e.g., meta-data) on
    the Web. The core of a UML class model can be expressed as an RDF
    vocabulary. However, many types of integrity constraints cannot be
    expressed in RDF. The W3C has therefore defined an extension of RDF,
    called the <span class="italic">Web Ontology Language</span> (<a class="link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/" target="_top">OWL</a>), which
    allows to formalize the core logic (classes, properties and integrity
    constraints) of a UML class model in the form of an <span class="italic">OWL ontology</span>.</p></div><p>An <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">association</span></strong></span> line connects two class
  rectangles. The purpose of an association is to classify relationships
  (links) between objects. While UML classes have a direct counterpart in the
  class concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages, UML
  associations do not have such a direct OOP counterpart. They are therefore
  often more difficult to understand for developers. Only in the special case
  of a unidirectional functional association there is a direct OOP
  counterpart: a reference property for referencing the objects that are
  linked to a given object by the association.</p><p>From a logical point of view, a class model defines a vocabulary, or
  language, for expressing various types of fact statements about objects. The
  knowledge representation languages <span class="italic">RDF</span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e3624"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d5e3626"></a> and <span class="italic">OWL</span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e3630"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d5e3632"></a> allow to formalize the vocabularies defined by class models
  and the fact statements made when instantiating their classes by creating
  objects. In this way, they help to understand the semantics of information
  models.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3635"></a>1.&nbsp;Classes with Properties and Methods</h2></div></div></div><p>In a UML class diagram,<a class="indexterm" name="d5e3638"></a> a class has a name (shown in the first compartment of the
    class rectangle), and it may have properties (shown in the second
    compartment) and methods (shown in the third compartment). Properties and
    methods may be described with or without details. The following diagrams
    illustrate these options using the example of a class <code class="code">books</code>
    or <code class="code">Book</code> for describing books as information objects.</p><p>A class can be expressed in UML by just providing its name, without
    any further detail, like so</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../fig/Class-books-with-1-compartment.svg"></div></div><p>This option is useful for making sketches and overview diagrams.
    Using an ordinary English plural name like <code class="code">books</code> makes the
    class diagram more readable for non-tech-savvy people.</p><p>A more informative description of a class is obtained by listing its
    properties, possibly without any further detail, like in the following
    example:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../fig/Class-books-with-2-compartments-no-details.svg"></div></div><p>However, for better understanding the meaning of properties and for
    being able to code a class in an OO programming language, we need to know
    the <span class="italic">range</span> of each property, which is
    the type of its values. The range of a property can be either a primitive
    datatype or another class.</p><p>In the following diagram we use general implementation-agnostic
    datatype names (like &#8220;Integer&#8221;), for which a specific programming language
    may have specific names (like &#8220;int&#8221; in Java). Notice that we now use a
    common OOP naming convention of giving classes a capitalized singular
    (mixed-case) name like <code class="code">Book</code> (or <code class="code">LearningUnit</code>).
    This allows saying that &#8220;an instance of a class <code class="code">C</code> is a C
    (object)&#8221;, like &#8220;an instance of <code class="code">Book</code> is a book
    (object)&#8221;.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../fig/Class-Book-with-2-compartments.svg"></div></div><p>Notice how the standard identifier attribute <code class="code">isbn</code> is
    marked with the keyword <code class="code">id</code> appended to the property
    declaration in curly braces. This is the UML syntax for defining several
    kinds of property constraints discussed in the next chapter.</p><p>Finally, we can also define the methods and functions of a class in
    a third compartment, like so:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../fig/Class-Book-with-3-compartments.svg"></div></div><p>In this example, the <code class="code">Book</code> class has a function
    <code class="code">checkISBN</code>, which returns a string. Given a class diagram in
    this form, it is straightforward to code it in an OO programming language
    like JavaScript or Java.</p><p>Recall that in JavaScript a class is defined in the form of a
    constructor function that assigns the values of its parameters to the
    properties of the newly created object, like so:</p><pre class="programlisting">// **JavaScript code**
var Book = function (i, t, y) {
  this.isbn = i;  // string
  this.title = t; // string
  this.year = y;  // number (integer)
}</pre><p>In JavaScript, the (instance-level) methods of a class are defined
    as method slots of the constructor&#8217;s built-in <code class="code">prototype</code>
    object. This is how we code the <code class="code">checkISBN</code> method:</p><pre class="programlisting">// **JavaScript code**
Book.prototype.checkISBN = function () {
  // regular expression pattern matching test
  if (!/\b\d{9}(\d|X)\b/.test( this.isbn)) {
    return "The ISBN must be a 10-digit string or " +
        "a 9-digit string followed by 'X'!";
  } else return "";
}</pre><p>If we don&#8217;t have to care about older web browsers, such as Internet
    Explorer 9, we can also use the new <code class="code">class</code> definition syntax
    (introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript) and combine the definition
    of properties and methods in one piece of code:</p><pre class="programlisting">class <span class="bold"><strong>Book</strong></span>  {   // **JavaScript (ES6) code**
  <span class="bold"><strong>constructor</strong></span>( i, t, y) { 
    this.isbn = i;  // string 
    this.title = t; // string 
    this.year = y; // number (integer) 
  }
  // instance-level methods
  <span class="bold"><strong>checkISBN</strong></span>() { 
    // regular expression pattern matching test 
    if (!/\b\d{9}(\d|X)\b/.test( this.isbn)) { 
      return "The ISBN must be a 10-digit string or " + 
          "a 9-digit string followed by 'X'!"; 
    } else return "";
  } 
}</pre><p>As opposed to JavaScript, Java has always had a language element
    <code class="code">class</code> for defining classes:</p><pre class="programlisting">public class <span class="bold"><strong>Book</strong></span> {   // **Java code**
  private String isbn;
  private String title;
  private int year;

  // Constructor
  public <span class="bold"><strong>Book</strong></span>( String i, String t, int y) {
    this.isbn = i;
    this.title = t; 
    this.year = y;
  }
  // instance-level methods
  public <span class="bold"><strong>checkISBN</strong></span>() { 
    ... 
  } 
}</pre><p>We need to be aware of the ambiguity of the term &#8220;object&#8221;. We have
    to distinguish between objects in the sense of real-world objects (also
    called &#8220;business objects&#8221; or &#8220;entities&#8221;) and objects in an OO program,
    such as JS objects or Java objects. When we want to manage information
    about business objects of some type in an app, we represent them in the
    form of JS/Java objects instantiating a JS/Java class that represents
    their (business) object type. We call these classes <span class="italic">model classes</span> for two reasons: first because they
    implement the classes defined in an app&#8217;s data model, and second because
    they represent the &#8216;model&#8217; part of an app's
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Model-View-Controller</em></span> codebase architecture.</p><p>Therefore, in a JS/Java app, a business object is a JS/Java object,
    but not every JS/Java object represents a business object because we use
    JS/Java objects for many purposes (e.g., in JavaScript, an array is a a JS
    object, but it's not a business object). The same applies to classes:
    (business) object types are represented as model classes, but not every
    JS/Java class is a model class because we may use JS/Java classes also for
    other purposes (e.g., in Java, a class can be used as a container for a
    method library, but such a class is not a model class).</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04s14.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch05s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">14.&nbsp;Quiz Questions&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Connecting Classes with Associations</td></tr></table></div></body>
