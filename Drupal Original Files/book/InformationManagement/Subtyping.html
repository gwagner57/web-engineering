For instance, we say that a bird <em>is</em> an animal, or that the class of all birds <em>is a subclass of</em> the class of all animals. In linguistics, the noun &quot;bird&quot; is a <em>hyponym</em> of the noun &quot;animal&quot;. </p><p>An entity type may be <em>specialized</em> by subtypes (for instance, <em>Bird</em> is specialized by <em>Parrot</em>) or <em>generalized</em> by supertypes (for instance, <em>Bird</em> and <em>Mammal</em> are generalized by <em>Animal</em>). Specialization and generalization are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>A subtype <em>inherits</em> all features from its supertypes. When a subtype inherits attributes, associations and constraints from a supertype, this means that these features need not be repeatedly rendered for the subtype in the class diagram, but the reader of the diagram has to understand that all features of a supertype also apply to its subtypes.</p><p>When an object type has more than one direct supertype, we have a case of multiple inheritance, which is common in conceptual modeling, but prohibited in many object-oriented programming languages, such as Java and C#, which only allow class hierarchies with a unique direct supertype for each object type.</p><section><h4>Introducing Subtypes by Specialization</h4><p>A new entity type may be introduced by specialization whenever it represents a special case of another entity type. We illustrate this for our example model shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="EntityTypes-as-Classes.html#EntityTypes-as-Classes__figMoviesCM"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-1</span></span></a>, which we are going to extend by introducing episodes of TV series and biographies as special cases of movies. This means that TV episodes and biographies also have a title, a release date and a director, but in addition they have further attributes such as <em>series name</em>, <em>season number</em> and <em>episode number</em> for TV episodes and an <em>about</em> attribute for biographies. Consequently, we introduce the entity types <em>TV episodes</em> and <em>biographies</em> by specializing the entity type <em>movies</em>, that is, as subtypes of <em>movies</em>. </p><figure id="Subtyping__figSpecialization"><img src="_res/Specialization_CM.svg" width="270" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-12</span>. </span>The entity types <em>TV episodes</em> and <em>biographies</em> specialize the entity type movies, thus inheriting its attributes.</figcaption></figure></section><section><h4>Introducing Supertypes by Generalization</h4><p>Consider the following model, which associates a director and actors with a movie.</p><figure id="Subtyping__figMoviesActorsDirectors"><img src="_res/Movies-Directors-Actors_CM.svg" width="300" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-13</span>. </span>The entity type <em>&quot;movies</em>&quot; is associated with the entity types <em>&quot;directors</em>&quot; and <em>&quot;actors</em>&quot;.</figcaption></figure><p>Notice that the entity types <em>actors</em> and <em>directors</em> share a number of attributes due to the fact that both actors and directors are people, and being an actor as well as being a director are roles played by people. So, we may generalize these two entity types by adding a joint supertype <em>people</em>, with the two attributes <em>name</em> and <em>birth date</em> that are shared by them, as shown in the following diagram.</p><figure id="Subtyping__figGeneralization"><img src="_res/Generalization_CM.svg" width="300" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-14</span>. </span>The entity types &quot;directors&quot; and &quot;actors&quot; have been generalized by the entity type &quot;people&quot;.</figcaption></figure><p>When generalizing two or more entity types, we move those features that are shared by them to the newly added supertype where they get &quot;centralized&quot;. In the case of <em>actors</em> and <em>directors</em>, this set of shared features includes <em>name</em> and <em>birth date</em>. In general, shared features may include attributes, associations and constraints.</p></section><section><h4>Segmentations and Type Hierarchies</h4><p>When an entity type is specialized by several subtypes that form a logical group, this is called a <em>segmentation</em>. A segmentation is <em>complete</em>, if the union of all subclass extensions is equal to the extension of the superclass (or, in other words, if all instances of the superclass instantiate some subclass). A segmentation is <em>disjoint</em>, if all subclasses are pairwise disjoint (or, in other words, if no instance of the superclass instantiates more than one subclass), otherwise, it is called <em>overlapping</em>. A complete and disjoint segmentation is a <em>partition</em>.</p>By default, when no constraint keyword is shown in a class diagram for a segmentation, then it is incomplete and overlapping. This is the case for the segmentation of <em>people</em> into <em>directors</em> and <em>actors</em> shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Subtyping__figGeneralization"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-14</span></span></a> above. Notice that this segmentation is overlapping because the director of a movie may also be an actor playing a certain role in that movie.<p>The segmentation of <em>movies</em> into <em>TV episodes</em> and <em>biographies</em> shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Subtyping__figSpecialization"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-12</span></span></a> above is disjoint, but incomplete. Consequently, the shared generalization arrow has to be annotated by the constraint keyword &quot;disjoint&quot; enclosed by curly braces, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Subtyping__figDisjointSegm"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-15</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="Subtyping__figDisjointSegm"><img src="_res/DisjointSegmentation.svg" width="300" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-15</span>. </span>The segmentation of <em>movies</em> into <em>TV episodes</em> and <em>biographies is disjoint, but incomplete</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>An example of a disjoint and complete segmentation, or partition, is the segmentation of <em>customers</em> into <em>private customers</em> and <em>corporate customers</em> shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Subtyping__figPartition"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-16</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="Subtyping__figPartition"><img src="_res/Partition_CM.svg" width="300" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-16</span>. </span>The segmentation of <em>customers</em> into <em>private customers</em> and <em>corporate customers</em> is a partition.</figcaption></figure><p>In general, segment subtypes may be further segmented, thus resulting in a <em>type hierarchy</em> (or <em>class hierarchy</em>). An example of such a type hierarchy is shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#Subtyping__figTypeHierarchy"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-17</span></span></a></p><figure id="Subtyping__figTypeHierarchy"><img src="_res/Vehicle-SingleInheritanceHierarchy.svg" width="400" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">4-17</span>. </span>A hierarchy of vehicle types with three segmentations.</figcaption></figure></section></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-first"><a href="InformationManagement.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-first-icon" title="First page
