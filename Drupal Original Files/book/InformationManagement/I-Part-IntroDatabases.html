Today, all this information is managed and used with the help of information and communication technologies, most notably with <i>database technologies</i>.</p><p>There are different paradigms for databases. For many years, the most important database paradigm for implementing business information systems are <em>relational databases</em>, which have been proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970. </p><p>An organization acts in a particular <em>domain</em>. For instance, a university acts in the domain of tertiary education, while a bank acts in the financial domain. </p><p>Since the real world essentially consists of <em>objects</em> and <em>events</em>, which may be collectively called <em>entities</em>, and their <em>relationships</em> with each other, a database managed by an organization has to be able to represent information about entities and about their <em>relationships</em> with each other. <em>Entity Relationship Diagrams</em>, discussed in <a class="role-part-ref" href="II-Part-InformationModeling.html"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">II</span>. </span>Information Modeling</a>, are a classical visual modeling language for capturing the business vocabulary of a domain as a basis for database design. </p><p>In a relational database, there are <em>entity table</em>s representing <em>entity types</em>, and <em>relationship tables</em> representing <em>relationship types</em>, such that the rows of a table represent entities or relationships.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-first"><a href="InformationManagement.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-first-icon" title="First page
