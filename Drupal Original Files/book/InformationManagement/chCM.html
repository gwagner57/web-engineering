A conceptual information model does not describe (the elements of) an IS. Rather, it describes (elements of) a real-world domain. The primary audience of a conceptual model are not IT experts, but subject matter experts for the business domain under investigation, such as marketing or controlling experts. The main purpose of a conceptual model is to serve as a basis in the communication between IT experts and business experts.</p><p>Conceptual information models can be expressed textually (e.g., in the form of a list of entity types, each described with a list of attributes) or visually, in the form of diagrams created with a diagram language, such as <em>Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)</em> or <em>UML Class Diagrams</em>. ERDs have been mainly used for designing Relational Databases, while Class Diagrams are being used both for designing the Java/C#/etc. classes of an app written in Java/C#/etc. and for designing the corresponding tables of the Relational Database underlying the app. </p><p>There are several tools that allow creating both Class Diagrams and ERDs. For instance, <em>StarUML</em> (http://staruml.io/) and <em>Visual Paradigm</em> (https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) are desktop tools that support both UML and ERDs. Visual Paradigm has a free trial version that can be used, however, for 30 days only, while StarUML has a free evaluation version without a time limit. </p><p><em>GenMyModel</em> (https://www.genmymodel.com/) is an online modeling tool that supports UML Class Diagrams (and other diagram types) and has free plan.</p></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-first"><a href="InformationManagement.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-first-icon" title="First page
