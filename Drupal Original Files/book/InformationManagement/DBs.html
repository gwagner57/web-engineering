In addition to the stored data items (the DB's content), a DB may also have a <i>data dictionary</i>, which contains the <em>database schema</em> defining the structure of the DB and its data items on the basis of an underlying set of elementary datatypes. </p><p>The stored data items are meaningful to the users of the DB. For instance, if the data items are binary large objects representing digital images, they can be presented to a DB user as an image on a computer screen such that the user is able to view and interpret the image. When the data items are records, they can be collectively presented to a DB user in a table or individually in a form consisting of data fields such that the user can interpret the field contents as information about an entity like a person or a bank account.</p><p>There are many different types of databases, distinguished by contents or by technologies. Examples of different DB types by contents are: phone number directories, image databases, and financial databases. Examples of different DB types by technologies are: Key-Value Stores, Relational Databases, Multi-Media Databases, XML Databases, Document Stores and Object Databases. There is a standard database programming language for relational databases: the <span class="italic"><i>Structured Query Language (SQL)</i></span>.</p><p>A phone number directory represents a <em>key-value store</em>. The names of people are the <em>keys</em> for looking up their phone numbers, which are the <em>values</em> associated with these keys. A key-value store can be presented in the form of a single table with just two columns: the first one for the keys and the second one for their values, such that each row represents a key-value pair, as shown in <a class="role-table-ref" href="#DBs__tblPhoneNoDir"><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">1-1</span></span></a> below.</p><table border="1" id="DBs__tblPhoneNoDir"><caption><span class="role-label">Table <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>A phone number directory as an example of a key-value store.</caption><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bob Jennings</td><td>(732) 516-8970</td></tr><tr><td>Jane Anselm</td><td>(732) 516-4301</td></tr><tr><td>Tara Helms</td><td>(504) 972-3381</td></tr><tr><td>Tom Miller</td><td>(282) 664-9357</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A financial database, containing data about bank accounts and their owners, is typically implemented as a <a class="role-index-anchor" id="DBs__I__1"></a> <em>Relational Database (RDB)</em>, which manages the different types of data (here: accounts and account owners) using different <i>database tables</i>. </p><p>An RDB can be presented in the form of a set of tables, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#DBs__figMovieDB"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span></span></a>, such that certain columns (normally the first column of a table) contain the <i>primary keys</i> that identify an entity represented by a table row. Often the primary key is provided by a special column called &quot;ID&quot;, which contains numbers that are internal identifiers, as in the tables shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#DBs__figMovieDB"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span></span></a> below. </p><figure id="DBs__figMovieDB"> <div><img height="227" src="_res/PeopleTbl.png" width="275" /> <img height="131" src="_res/MovieTbl.png" width="447" /></div> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>A relational database with two tables: <i>People</i> and <i>Movies</i>.</figcaption> </figure></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-first"><a href="InformationManagement.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-first-icon" title="First page
