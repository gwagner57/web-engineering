   part-whole-association concepts <span class="italic">aggregation</span> and <span class="italic">composition</span>. The main problem is the widespread misunderstanding (even
   among expert software developers and among the authors of UML) that the concept of composition
   implies a life-cycle dependency between the whole and its parts such that the parts cannot exist
   without the whole. But this view ignores the fact that there are also cases of
   part-whole-associations with non-shareable parts where the parts can be detached from and survive
   the destruction of the whole. </p><p>In the UML specification document, the definition of the term "composition" has always
   implied non-shareable parts, but it has not been clear what is the defining characteristic of
   "composition", and what is merely an optional characteristic. Even in the new version (as of
   2015), UML 2.5, after an attempt to improve the definition of the term "composition", it remains
   still ambiguous and doesn't provide any guidance how to model part-whole-associations with
   non-shareable parts where the parts can be detached from, and survive the destruction of, the
   whole as opposed to the case where the parts cannot be detached and are destroyed together with
   the whole. They say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If a composite object is deleted, all of its part instances that are
    objects are deleted with it.</p></blockquote></div><p>But at the same time they also say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A part object may be removed from a composite object before the composite
    object is deleted, and thus not be deleted as part of the composite object.</p></blockquote></div><p>This confusion points to an incompleteness of the UML definition, which does not account for
   life-cycle dependencies between components and composites. It's therefore important to understand
   how the UML definition can be enhanced by introducing a UML stereotype for &lt;&lt;<span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">inseparable</span></strong></span>&gt;&gt; compositions where
   components cannot be detached from their composite, and, thus, have to be destroyed whenever
   their composite is destroyed.</p><p>As <a class="link" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AggregationAndComposition.html" target="_top">Martin
    Fowler has explained</a>, the main issue for characterizing composition is that "an object
   can only be the part of one composition relationship". This is also explained in the blog post
    <a class="link" href="http://bellekens.com/2010/12/20/uml-composition-vs-aggregation-vs-association/" target="_top">UML
    Composition vs Aggregation vs Association</a> by Geert Bellekens. In addition to this
   defining characteristic of a composition (to have <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">exclusive</span></strong></span>, or <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">non-shareable</span></strong></span>, parts), a composition may also come with a life-cycle
   dependency between the composite and its components. In fact, there are two kinds of such
   dependencies:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Whenever a component <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">must always be attached</span></strong></span>
    to a composite, or, in other words, when it has a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">mandatory
     composite</span></strong></span>, as expressed by the "exactly one" multiplicity at the composite side 
     of the composition line, then it must either be re-used in (or re-attached to) another composite, or destroyed,
     when its current composite is destroyed. This is exemplified by the composition between <code class="code">Person</code>
    and <code class="code">Heart</code>, shown in the diagram below. A heart is either destroyed or transplanted to another
     person, when its owner has died.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Whenever a component <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">cannot not be detached</span></strong></span>
    from its composite, or, in other words, when it is <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">inseparable</span></strong></span>, then, and only then, the component has to be destroyed, 
     when its composite is destroyed. An example of such a composition with inseparable parts is 
     the composition between <code class="code">Person</code> and <code class="code">Brain</code>.</p></li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../../fig/PartWhole-Composition-Inseparabale.svg"></div><p>In summary, life-cycle dependencies only apply to specific cases of composition, but not in
   general. They are, therefore, not a defining characteristic. The UML spec states: "A part may be
   removed from a composite instance before the composite instance is deleted, and thus not be
   deleted as part of the composite instance." </p><p>In the example of a <code class="code">Car</code>-<code class="code">Engine</code> composition, as shown in the
   following diagram, it's clearly the case that the engine can be detached from the car before the
   car is destroyed, in which case the engine is not destroyed and can be re-used. This is implied
   by the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">zero or one</span></strong></span>
   multiplicity at the composite side of the composition line.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../../fig/Car-Engine-Composition.svg"></div><p>The <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">multiplicity</span></strong></span> of a
   composition's association end at the whole side is either 1 or 0..1, depending on the fact if
   parts are <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">separable</span></strong></span>, that is,
   if they can be detached and exist on their own.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch16.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch16.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="pt05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Part-Whole Associations&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Part&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Inheritance in Class Hierarchies</td></tr></table></div></body>
