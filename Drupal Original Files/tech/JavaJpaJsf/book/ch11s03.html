			domain class. This requires to connect the domain class and the range class of the reference
			property with an association line and annotate the end of this line at the range class side
			with a "dot", with the property name and with a multiplicity symbol, as shown in Figure <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#figCommitteChairAssEnd" title="Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by an association end with a &#34;dot&#34;">11.2</a> below for the case of our
			example. In this way we get a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">unidirectional
					association</span></strong></span>, the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">source</span></strong></span> class of which is the property's <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">domain</span></strong></span> and the <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">target</span></strong></span> class of which is the property's
				<span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">range</span></strong></span>.</p><p>The fact that an association end is owned by the class at the other end is visually
			expressed with the help of a small filled circle (also called a "dot") at the end of the
			association line. This is illustrated in Figure <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#figCommitteChairAssEnd" title="Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by an association end with a &#34;dot&#34;">11.2</a> below, where the "dot" at the association end
				<code class="code">chair</code> indicates that the association end represents a reference property
				<code class="code">chair</code> in the class <code class="code">Committee</code> having <code class="code">ClubMember</code> as
			range.</p><div class="figure"><a name="figCommitteChairAssEnd"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by an association end with a "dot"</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../../fig/CommitteeChair_DesM.svg" alt="A committee has a club member as chair expressed by an association end with a &#34;dot&#34;"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Thus, the two diagrams shown in Figure <a class="xref" href="ch11.html#figCommitteChairRefProp" title="Figure&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by the reference property chair">11.1</a> and Figure <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#figCommitteChairAssEnd" title="Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by an association end with a &#34;dot&#34;">11.2</a> express essentially equivalent models. When a reference
			property is modeled by an association end with a "dot", like <code class="code">chair</code> in Figure
				<a class="xref" href="ch11.html#figCommitteChairRefProp" title="Figure&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by the reference property chair">11.1</a>, then the
			property's multiplicity is attached to the association end. Since in a design model, all
			association ends need to have a multiplicity, we also have to define a multiplicity for the
			other end at the side of the <code class="code">Committee</code> class, which represents the inverse of the
			property. This multiplicity (of the inverse property) is not available in the original
			property description in the model shown in Figure <a class="xref" href="ch11.html#figCommitteChairRefProp" title="Figure&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by the reference property chair">11.1</a>, so it has to be added according to the intended semantics
			of the association. It can be obtained by answering the question "is it mandatory that any
				<code class="code">ClubMember</code> is the <code class="code">chair</code> of a <code class="code">Committee</code>?" for finding
			the minimum cardinality and the question "can a <code class="code">ClubMember</code> be the
				<code class="code">chair</code> of more than one <code class="code">Committee</code>?" for finding the maximum
			cardinality.</p><p>When the value of a property is a set of values from its range, the property is <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">non-functional</span></strong></span> and its
			multiplicity is either <code class="code">0..*</code> or <code class="code">n..*</code> where n &gt; 0. Instead of
				<code class="code">0..*</code>, which means "neither mandatory nor functional", we can simply write the
			asterisk symbol <code class="code">*</code>. The association shown in Figure <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#figCommitteChairAssEnd" title="Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by an association end with a &#34;dot&#34;">11.2</a> assigns at most one
			object of type <code class="code">ClubMember</code> as chair to an object of type <code class="code">Committee</code>.
			Consequently, it's an example of a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">functional
					association</span></strong></span>.</p><p>The following table provides an overview about the different cases of functionality of an
			association: </p><div class="table"><a name="d5e3936"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;11.3.&nbsp;Functionality types</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table frame="border" rules="all"><thead><tr>
						<th>Functionality type</th>
						<th>Meaning</th>
					</tr></thead><tbody><tr>
						<td>one-to-one</td>
						<td>both functional and inverse functional</td>
					</tr><tr>
						<td>many-to-one</td>
						<td>functional</td>
					</tr><tr>
						<td>one-to-many</td>
						<td>inverse functional</td>
					</tr><tr>
						<td>many-to-many</td>
						<td>neither functional nor inverse functional</td>
					</tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><br class="table-break"></p><p>Notice that the directionality and the functionality type of an association are independent
			of each other. So, a unidirectional association can be either functional (one-to-one or
			many-to-one), or non-functional (one-to-many or many-to-many).</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch11s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch11.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch11s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.&nbsp;Referential Integrity&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Representing Unidirectional Associations as Reference Properties</td></tr></table></div></body>
