   source class, which means that the values of the corresponding multi-valued reference property
   are sets. However, there are also cases, where a non-functional association end is <span class="italic">ordered</span> (representing a list of objects) and, consequently, the values
   of the corresponding multi-valued reference property take the form of <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">ordered sets</span></strong></span>. In the following example, the
   association end <code class="code">authoredBooks</code> is not ordered, while the other one, with the implicit
   name <code class="code">authors</code>, is ordered since the order of the authors of a book is meaningful and
   has to be captured by a data management app.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../../fig/Book-Author_Bidir_DesM.svg"></div><p>An ordered association end should not represent any ordering based on the properties of the
   target class. In our example, this implies that the ordering of the authors of a book should, for
   example, not represent their alphabetical ordering, but rather it should represent information
   that is not available via the properties of <code class="code">Author</code>. This is, indeed, the case, since
   it represents some sort of significance, which is not expressed by any property.</p><p>Notice that ordered association ends in information design models are just a convenience
   feature, because an ordered association end can always be transformed into an unordered one by
   adding one or more attributes to the association's target class, such that these attributes'
   values can be used for the ordering. Ordered association ends allow a more concise information
   model, and a more efficient implementation, by not requiring to make the ordering information
   explicit with the help of auxiliary ordering attributes.</p><p>The two important types of collections for multi-valued reference properties are <span class="italic">sets</span> and <span class="italic">ordered sets</span>, while use
   cases for <span class="italic">bags</span> (multi-sets) and <span class="italic">sequences</span> (ordered multi-sets) as the collection type of a multi-valued reference
   property are very rare. When the collection type of a multi-valued reference property is bag,
   this can be expressed in the class diagram with the help of the keyword <code class="code">unique</code> in
   the annotation of the association end or property modifier.</p><p>Notice, however, that it is quite common to use <span class="italic">lists</span>
   (such as JS arrays or the Java interface type <code class="code">List</code>) as the range of multi-valued
   reference properties, also in the  case where the collection is of type <span class="italic">set</span>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch11s08.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch11.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch11s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">8.&nbsp;Rendering Reference Properties in the User Interface&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Quiz Questions</td></tr></table></div></body>
