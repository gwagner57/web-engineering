    diagram, we typically end up with a model containing one or more
    associations that do not have any ownership defined for their ends, as,
    for instance, in <a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#figCommitteChairDomM" title="Figure&nbsp;8.4.&nbsp;A model of a non-directed association between Committee and ClubMember">Figure&nbsp;8.4</a> below. When there is no ownership dot at
    either end of an association, such as in this example, this means that the
    model does not specify how the association is to be represented (or
    realized) with the help of reference properties. Such an association does
    not have any direction. According to the UML 2.5 specification, the ends
    of such an association are "owned" by itself, and not by any of the
    classes participating in it.</p><div class="figure"><a name="figCommitteChairDomM"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.4.&nbsp;A model of a non-directed association between Committee and
      ClubMember</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="500"><tr><td><img src="../../fig/CommitteeChair_DomM.svg" width="500" alt="A model of a non-directed association between Committee and ClubMember"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>An information design model that contains an association without
    association end ownership dots is acceptable as a <span class="italic">relational database</span> design model, but it is
    incomplete as a design model for OOP languages.</p><p>For instance, the model of <a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#figCommitteChairDomM" title="Figure&nbsp;8.4.&nbsp;A model of a non-directed association between Committee and ClubMember">Figure&nbsp;8.4</a> provides a relational database design with two
    entity tables, <code class="code">committees</code> and <code class="code">clubmembers</code>, and a
    separate one-to-one relationship table
    <code class="code">committee_has_clubmember_as_chair</code>. But it does not provide a
    design for Java classes, since it does not specify how the association is
    to be implemented with the help of reference properties.</p><p>There are three options how to turn an information design model of a
    non-directed association<a class="indexterm" name="d5e5622"></a> (without any association end ownership dots) into an
    information design model where all associations are either unidirectional
    or bidirectional: we can place an ownership dot at either end or at both
    ends of the association. Each of these three options defines a different
    way how to represent, or implement, the association with the help of
    reference properties. So, for the association shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#figCommitteChairDomM" title="Figure&nbsp;8.4.&nbsp;A model of a non-directed association between Committee and ClubMember">Figure&nbsp;8.4</a> above, we have
    the following options:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Place an ownership dot at the <code class="code">chair</code> association
        end, leading to the model shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s03.html#figCommitteChairAssEnd" title="Figure&nbsp;8.2.&nbsp;An association end with a &#34;dot&#34;">Figure&nbsp;8.2</a> above,
        which can be transformed into the OO class model shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#figCommitteChairRefProp" title="Figure&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp;A committee has a club member as chair expressed by the reference property chair">Figure&nbsp;8.1</a>
        above.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Place an ownership dot at the <code class="code">chairedCommittee</code>
        association end, leading to the completed models shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html#figChairedCommitte" title="Figure&nbsp;8.8.&nbsp;Turning a functional association end into a reference property">Figure&nbsp;8.8</a> below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make the association bidirectional by placing ownership dots at
        both association ends, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#figBidirectionalCommitteClubmemberAssoc" title="Figure&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;Modeling a bidirectional association between Committee and ClubMember">Figure&nbsp;8.5</a> with the meaning that the association is
        implemented in a redundant manner by a pair of mutually inverse
        reference properties <code class="code">Committee</code>::<code class="code">chair</code> and
        <code class="code">ClubMember</code>::<code class="code">chairedCommittee</code>, as discussed
        in <span class="phrase"><a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Bidirectional Associations">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>.</span></p><div class="figure"><a name="figBidirectionalCommitteClubmemberAssoc"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;Modeling a bidirectional association between Committee and
          ClubMember</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="500"><tr><td><img src="../../fig/CommitteeChair_DesM3.svg" width="500" alt="Modeling a bidirectional association between Committee and ClubMember"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></li></ol></div><p>So, whenever we have modeled an association, we have to make a
    choice, which of its ends represents a reference property and will
    therefore be marked with an ownership dot. It can be either one, or both.
    This decision also implies a decision about the <span class="italic">navigability</span><a class="indexterm" name="d5e5652"></a> of the association. When an association end represents a
    reference property, this implies that it is navigable (via this
    property).</p><p>In the case of a functional association that is not one-to-one, the
    simplest design is obtained by defining the direction of the association
    according to its functionality, placing the association end ownership dot
    at the association end with the multiplicity <code class="code">0..1</code> or
    <code class="code">1</code>. For a non-directed one-to-one or many-to-many association,
    we can choose the direction as we like, that is, we can place the
    ownership dot at either association end.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08s04.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch08s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4.&nbsp;Representing Unidirectional Associations as Reference
