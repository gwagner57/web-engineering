      minimum functionality of a data management app only. It does not take
      care of preventing users from entering invalid data into the app's
      database. In <span class="phrase"><a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Implementing Constraint Validation in a Plain JS Web App">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>,</span>   we show how to express integrity
      constraints in a model class, and how to perform data validation both in
      the model/storage code of the app and in the HTML5-based user
      interface.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2178"></a>10.2.&nbsp;Database size and memory management</h3></div></div></div><p>Notice that in this 
      <span class="phrase">chapter,</span> we have made the
      assumption that all application data can be loaded into main memory
      (like all book data is loaded into the map <code class="code">Book.instances</code>).
      This approach only works in the case of local data storage of smaller
      databases, say, with not more than 2 MB of data, roughly corresponding
      to 10 tables with an average population of 1000 rows, each having an
      average size of 200 Bytes. When larger databases are to be managed, or
      when data is stored remotely, it's no longer possible to load the entire
      population of all tables into main memory, but we have to use a
      technique where only parts of the table contents are loaded.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2183"></a>10.3.&nbsp;Boilerplate code</h3></div></div></div><p>Another issue with the do-it-yourself code of this example app is
      the <span class="italic">boilerplate<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2187"></a> code</span> needed per model class for the data
      storage management methods <code class="code">add</code>, <code class="code">retrieve</code>,
      <code class="code">update</code>, and <code class="code">destroy</code>. While it is good to write
      this code a few times for learning app development, you don't want to
      write it again and again later when you work on real projects. In
       <span class="phrase">Volume 2,</span>
      we present an approach how to put these methods in a generic form in a
      meta-class, such that they can be reused in all model classes of an
      app.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2194"></a>10.4.&nbsp;Serializing and de-serializing attribute values</h3></div></div></div><p>Serializing an attribute value means to convert it to a suitable
      string value. For standard datatypes, such as numbers, a standard
      serialization<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2197"></a> is provided by the predefined conversion function
      <code class="code">String</code>. When a string value, like "13" or "yes", represents
      the value of a non-string-valued attribute, it has to be <span class="italic">de-serialized</span>, that is, converted to the range
      type of the attribute, before it is assigned to the attribute. This is
      the situation, for instance, when a user has entered a value in a form
      input field for an integer-valued attribute. The value of the form field
      is of type string, so it has to be converted (de-serialized) to an
      integer using the predefined conversion function
      <code class="code">parseInt</code>.</p><p>For instance, in our example app, we have the integer-valued
      attribute <code class="code">year</code>. When the user has entered a value for this
      attribute in a corresponding form field, in the <span class="italic">Create</span> or <span class="italic">Update</span> user interface, the form field holds a
      string value, which has to be converted to an integer in an assignment
      like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">this.year = <span class="bold"><strong>parseInt</strong></span>( formEl.year.value);</pre><p>One important question is: where should we take care of
      de-serialization: in the "view" (before the value is passed to the
      "model" layer), or in the "model"? Since attribute range types are a
      business concern, and the business logic of an app is supposed to be
      encapsulated in the "model", de-serialization<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2209"></a> should be performed in the "model" layer, and not in the
      "view".</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2211"></a>10.5.&nbsp;Implicit versus explicit form field labels</h3></div></div></div><p>The explicit labeling<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2214"></a> of form fields requires to add an <code class="code">id</code> value
      to the <code class="code">input</code> element and a <code class="code">for</code>-reference to
      its <code class="code">label</code> element as in the following
      example:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;label for="isbn"&gt;ISBN:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="isbn" name="isbn" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>This technique for associating a label with a form field is
      getting quite inconvenient when we have many form fields on a page
      because we have to make up a great many of unique <code class="code">id</code> values
      and have to make sure that they don't conflict with any of the
      <code class="code">id</code> values of other elements on the same page. It's
      therefore preferable to use an approach, called <span class="italic">implicit labeling</span>,<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2227"></a> where these <code class="code">id</code> references are not needed. In
      this approach, the <code class="code">input</code> element is a child element of its
      <code class="code">label</code> element, as in </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;ISBN: &lt;input name="isbn" /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>Having <code class="code">input</code> elements as child elements of their
      <code class="code">label</code> elements doesn't seem very logical. Rather, one would
      expect the <code class="code">label</code> to be a child of an <code class="code">input</code>
      element. But that's the way it is defined in HTML5.</p><p>A small disadvantage of using implicit labels may be the lack of
      support by certain CSS libraries. In the following parts of this
      tutorial, we will use our own CSS styling for implicitly labeled form
      fields.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2241"></a>10.6.&nbsp;Synchronizing views with the model</h3></div></div></div><p>When an app is used by more than one user at the same time, we
      have to take care of somehow synchronizing the possibly concurrent
      read/write actions of users such that users always have current data in
      their "views" and are prevented from interfering with each other. This
      is a very difficult problem, which is attacked in different ways by
      different approaches. It has been mainly investigated for multi-user
      database management systems and large enterprise applications built on
      top of them.</p><p>The original MVC proposal included a data binding<a class="indexterm" name="d5e2245"></a> mechanism for automated one-way model-to-view
      synchronization (updating the model's views whenever a change in the
      model data occurs). We didn't take care of this in our minimal app
      because a front-end app with local storage doesn't really have multiple
      concurrent users. However, we can create a (rather artificial) situation
      that illustrates the issue:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open the <span class="italic">Update</span> UI page of
          the minimal app twice (for instance, by opening
          <code class="filename">updateLearningUnit.html</code> twice), such that you
          get two browser tabs rendering the same page.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select the same learning unit on both tabs, such that you see
          its data in the <span class="italic">Update</span>
          view.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change one data item of this learning unit on one of the tabs
          and save your change.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When you now go to the other tab, you still see the old data
          value, while you may have expected that it would have been
          automatically updated.</p></li></ol></div><p>A mechanism for automatically updating all views of a model object
      whenever a change in its property values occurs is provided by the
      <span class="italic">observer pattern</span> that treats any view
      as an observer of its model object. Applying the observer pattern
      requires that (1) model objects can have a multi-valued reference
      property like <span class="italic">observers</span>, which holds
      a set of references to view objects; (2) a <span class="italic">notify</span> method can be invoked on view objects by
      the model object whenever one of its property values is changed; and (3)
      the <span class="italic">notify</span> method defined for view
      objects takes care of refreshing the user interface.</p><p>Notice, however, that the general model-view synchronization
      problem is not really solved by automatically updating all (other
      users') views of a model object whenever a change in its data occurs.
      Because this would only help, if the users of these views didn't make
      themselves any change of the data item concerned, meanwhile. Otherwise,
      their changed data value would be overwritten by the automated refresh,
      and they may not even notice this, which is not acceptable in terms of
      usability.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2265"></a>10.7.&nbsp;Architectural separation of concerns</h3></div></div></div><p>From an architectural point of view, it is important to keep the
      app's model classes independent of </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>the user interface (UI) code because it should be possible
            to re-use the same model classes with different UI
            technologies;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the storage management code because it should be possible to
            re-use the same model classes with different storage
            technologies.</p></li></ol></div><p>In this   <span class="phrase">chapter,</span> we have kept the model class
      <code class="code">Book</code> independent of the UI code, since it does not contain
      any references to UI elements, nor does it invoke any view method.
      However, for simplicity, we didn't keep it independent of storage
      management code, since we have included the method definitions for add,
      update, destroy, etc., which invoke the storage management methods of
      JavaScrpt's <code class="code">localStorage</code> API. Therefore, the separation of
      concerns is incomplete in our minimal example app.</p><p>We show in  <span class="phrase">Volume 2</span>
      how to achieve a more complete separation of concerns by defining
      abstract storage management methods in a special storage manager class,
      which is complemented by libraries of concrete storage management
      methods for specific storage technologies, called <span class="italic">storage adapters</span>.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s09.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">9.&nbsp;Possible Variations and Extensions&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Practice Projects</td></tr></table></div></body>
