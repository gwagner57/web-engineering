        telling the browser how to render their HTML (or XML) contents: using
        which layout of content elements, which fonts and text styles, which
        colors, which backgrounds, and which animations. Normally, these
        settings are made in a separate CSS file that is associated with an

        data files and messages in a machine-readable way. XML may also be
        human-readable, if the tag names used are self-explaining. XML is
        based on Unicode. SVG and MathML are based on XML, and there is an
        XML-based version of HTML.</p><p>XML provides a syntax for expressing structured information in
        the form of an <span class="italic">XML document</span> with
        <span class="italic">elements</span> and their <span class="italic">attributes</span>. The specific elements and

        Internet technologies TCP/IP and DNS, using human-readable text
        messages for the communication between web clients and web servers.
        The main purpose of HTTP has been to allow fetching web documents
        identified by URLs from a web browser, and invoking the operations of
        a back-end web application program from an HTML form executed by a web
        browser. More recently, HTTP is increasingly used for providing web
        APIs and web services.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv"><h3 class="title">I</h3><dl><dt><a name="IANA"></a><span class="glossterm">IANA</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>IANA stands for <span class="italic">Internet Assigned

        of separation of concerns, mainly between the model and the view, and
        considering the model as the most fundamental part of an app. In MVC
        frameworks, "M", "V" and "C" are defined in different ways. Often the
        term &#8220;model&#8221; refers to the app&#8217;s data sources, while the &#8220;view&#8221;
        denotes the app&#8217;s code for the user interface, which is based on
        CSS-styled HTML forms and DOM events, and the &#8220;controller&#8221; typically
        denotes the (glue) code that is in charge of mediating between the

        <span class="emphasis"><em>objects</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>classes</em></span>
        instantiated by objects. Classes are like blueprints for objects: they

        <span class="emphasis"><em>methods</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>functions</em></span> that can
        be applied to them. A higher-level characteristic of OOP is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>inheritance</em></span> in class hierarchies: a subclass
        inherits the features (properties, methods and constraints) of its
        superclass. </p></dd><dt><a name="OWL"></a><span class="glossterm"><span class="italic">Web Ontology

        Web. It allows defining vocabularies (mainly classes with properties)
        and supports expressing many types of integrity constraints on them.
        OWL is the basis for performing automated inferences, such as checking
        the consistency of an OWL vocabulary. Vocabularies, or data models,
        defined in the form of UML class models can be converted to OWL
        vocabularies and then checked for consistency.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv"><h3 class="title">P</h3><dl><dt><a name="PNG"></a><span class="glossterm"><span class="italic">Portable Network

        program (for instance, in a Java object), a slot normally is a
        property-value pair. But in a JavaScript object, a slot may also
        consist of a method name and a method body or it may be a key-value

        in the range between 0 and 1,114,111. For example, the Greek letter &#960;
        has the code 960. Unicode includes legacy character sets like ASCII
        and ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) as subsets.</p><p>XML is based on Unicode. Consequently, the Greek letter &#960; (with
        code 960) can be inserted in an XML document as &amp;#960; using the
        XML entity syntax. The default encoding of Unicode characters in an
        XML document is UTF-8, which uses only a single byte for ASCII
        characters, but three bytes for less common characters.</p></dd><dt><a name="URI"></a><span class="glossterm">Uniform Resource Identifier</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>A URI is either a <span class="emphasis"><em>Uniform Resource Locator
