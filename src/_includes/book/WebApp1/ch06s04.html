   but with different meanings ascribed to "M", "V" and "C". In some approaches it is extended by
   adding <span class="italic">view models (VM)</span> as another layer.</p><p>In the original MVC proposal, the "model" consists of <span class="italic">model classes</span> implementing the app's data model,
    while today many MV(VM)(C) frameworks do not include any concept of model
    classes, but rather refer to data objects (or records) as "models". Also
    the term "controller" is ambiguous today. In the original MVC proposal,
    the term "controller" referred to the handling of UI events including user
    inputs. Today, it typically refers to all the glue code needed for
    mediating between the model and the view, including the code for
    routing.</p><p>In summary, in today's frameworks, the term "model" vaguely refers to the data sources of
   an app, while the "view" denotes the app's code for the user interface, which is based on
   CSS-styled HTML forms and DOM event listeners, and the "controller" typically denotes the (glue)
   code that is in charge of mediating between the <span class="italic">view</span> and the
    <span class="italic">model</span>. There is widespread agreement that</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>the model should be independent of the view and the controller,
        implying that the model must neither invoke the view nor the
        controller (in the model code, there should be no calls of any view or
        controller procedures);</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the controller may invoke both the model and the view;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the view may invoke the controller.</p></li></ol></div><p>However, as shown in the following diagram, it is not clear if the <span class="italic">view</span> may also invoke the <span class="italic">model</span>, or if it needs to route any calls of model
    procedures via the <span class="italic">controller</span>. Both
    approaches are being used in practice. The first approach, where model
    procedures can be called from the <span class="italic">view</span>,
    is simpler and leads to a leaner <span class="italic">controller</span>.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="200"><tr><td><img src="../fig/Architecture-Plain-MVC.svg" width="200"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>The second approach, where the <span class="italic">view</span> is decoupled from the <span class="italic">model</span> by routing all calls to it via the
    <span class="italic">controller</span>, is called the <span class="italic">mediating-controller</span> MVC<a class="indexterm" name="d5e4304"></a> pattern, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06s04.html#figMediatingControllerMVC" title="Figure&nbsp;6.2.&nbsp;The mediating-controller MVC pattern">Figure&nbsp;6.2</a>. It has the advantage of fewer dependencies and
    providing better support for model-view synchronization based on
    data-bindings.</p><div class="figure"><a name="figMediatingControllerMVC"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.2.&nbsp;The mediating-controller MVC pattern</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="200"><tr><td><img src="../fig/Architecture-Mediating-Controller-MVC.svg" width="200" alt="The mediating-controller MVC pattern"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>In many MVC web application frameworks, the <span class="italic">model</span> is tightly coupled with the underlying data
    storage technology, often via an <span class="italic">object-relational
    mapping (ORM)</span> approach mapping classes to tables and objects to
    table rows. This tight coupling makes model classes dependent on a
    specific database technology or even on corresponding database tables. It
    therefore violates the onion principle, since the model is the most
    fundamental part of an app, so it must not depend on any other
    part.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch06s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3.&nbsp;"Logical" versus "Physical" User Interface&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Deployment Architectures</td></tr></table></div></body>
