An ID attribute represents a uniqueness constraint requiring that an attribute's value is unique among all entities of the given type. </p><p>For instance, in a UML class diagram representing a design model and containing the entity type <em>Book</em> we can define its <em>isbn</em> attribute and its <em>doi</em> attribute (holding the <em>digital object identifier</em> of the book) to be <em>unique</em>, or, in other words, to be a <em>key</em>, by appending the keyword &quot;key&quot; in curly braces to the attribute's definition in the <em>Book</em> class rectangle, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#StandardIdAttributes__figUniquenessConstraint"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-5</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="StandardIdAttributes__figUniquenessConstraint"><img src="_res/Book_withUniquenessConstraint.svg" width="150" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-5</span>. </span>A design model class with two unique (or key) attributes.</figcaption></figure><p>A <em>standard ID</em> attribute (combination), also called <em>primary key</em>, is a mandatory unique attribute (combination) that has been chosen among the ID attributes of the given class for providing the standard ID of an entity. </p><p>In a UML class diagram representing a design model, the standard ID attribute (combination) is marked up with the keyword &quot;id&quot; (as a ' property modifier') enclosed in curly braces.</p><p>Since the <em>doi</em> attribute is optional, it cannot be used as the standard ID attribute. Only the <em>isbn</em> attribute satisfies the requirements of a standard ID attribute and is designated as such in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#StandardIdAttributes__figStandardID1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-6</span></span></a>.</p><figure id="StandardIdAttributes__figStandardID1"><img src="_res/CM2DM3a.svg" width="150" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-6</span>. </span>A class with a (mandatory) standard ID attribute <em>isbn</em> and an optional unique attribute <em>doi</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>All entity types in a design model must have a standard ID attribute (combination). Since the subtypes of a type hierarchy inherit the standard ID attribute (combination) from their supertypes, there is no need to define one for them, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#StandardIdAttributes__figStandardID2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-7</span></span></a>.</p><p>Some entity types may come with a natural ID attribute in a conceptual model. For instance, the entity type <em>books</em> would be modeled with an <em>isbn</em> attribute, the values of which are unique book numbers. Whenever there is such a natural ID attribute, It is preferable to use it as the standard ID attribute of en entity type. </p><p>For other entity types, an artificial ID attribute has to be added for obtaining standard IDs for their instances. Such an attribute (sometimes called a <em>surrogate key</em>) is often defined as an automatically incremented sequence number. But it could also hold any alphanumeric code values.</p><p>For instance, in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#StandardIdAttributes__figStandardID2"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-7</span></span></a>, the class Person has a natural standard ID attribute, <em>socSecNo</em>, holding social security numbers, while <em>Movie</em> does not have such an attribute and, therefore, an artificial (integer-valued) standard ID attribute, called &quot;id&quot;, has been added to its set of attributes.</p><figure id="StandardIdAttributes__figStandardID2"><img src="_res/CM2DM3b.svg" width="300" /> <figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">5-7</span>. </span>The entity types &quot;Director&quot; and &quot;Actor&quot; inherit the standard ID attribute &quot;socSecNo&quot; from &quot;Person&quot;. </figcaption></figure> Notice that a standard ID declaration implies both a mandatory value and a uniqueness constraint on the attribute(s) concerned.<section><h4>Composite Standard IDs</h4><p>Often, practitioners recommended not using a composite ID as a standard ID, since composite IDs are more difficult to handle and not always supported by tools. Whenever the instances of an entity type do not have a simple ID, but only a composite one, it may therefore be preferable to add an artificial standard ID attribute (also called <em>surrogate</em> key) to the entity type. </p><p>However, each additional surrogate key has a price: it creates some cognitive and computational overhead. Consequently, in the case of a simple composite ID, it may be preferable not to add a surrogate key, but use the composite ID as the standard ID.</p><p>There is also an argument against using any natural attribute, such as the &quot;isbn&quot; attribute in the case of books, for a standard ID. The argument points to the risk that the values even of natural ID attributes like &quot;isbn&quot; may have to be changed during the life time of a business object, and any such change would require an unmanageable effort to change also all corresponding ID references. However, the business semantics of natural ID attributes implies that they are frozen. Thus, the need of a value change can only occur in the case of a data input error. But such a case is normally detected early in the life time of the object concerned, and at this stage the change of all corresponding ID references is still manageable.</p></section></section></main><footer class="page-navigation"><table><tr><td class="page-navigation-to-first"><a href="InformationManagement.html"><span class="page-navigation-to-first-icon" title="First page
