   JavaScript and Java. Web apps are designed with the help of information models in the form of UML

    programming language. It's essential that you understand all basic concepts and techniques, not
    just in programming, but also in information management.</p><p>A programming (or software development) technology typically combines a programming
    language, such as JavaScript, Java or C#, with a framework or library, such as BackboneJS, JSF
    or ASP.NET MVC, for programming user interfaces and data storage management.</p><p>Many developers seem to believe that all they need to learn and master for their
    professional career are the right programming technologies. However, they fail to master app
    development, if they don't manage to learn the general concepts and techniques needed for being
    able to apply programming technologies in the right way.</p><p>Understanding general concepts and techniques, in programming and information management,
    helps you to</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>better understand the elements of a language or framework by recognizing them as specific
      incarnations of general concepts,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>compare different technologies and assess their strengths and weaknesses,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>make an informed choice of a new promising language/technology suitable for your
      purposes.</p></li></ul></div><p>While technology-specific knowledge is important (in fact, it is the basis) for mastering
    programming and app development, it is also true that its half-time value is pretty short. In
    this book, we do not only explain programming and information management concepts and techniques
    in a technology-independent way, we also explain in which way these concepts and techniques are
    supported in the two most relevant technologies: JavaScript and Java.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index-2.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="pr01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Web Applications with JavaScript or Java&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index-2.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Why is JavaScript a Good Choice for Building Web Apps?</td></tr></table></div></body>
