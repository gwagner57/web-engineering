				Programming (OOP)</span>, in database languages (such as <span class="italic">SQL99</span>), in the XML schema definition language <span class="italic">XML
				Schema</span>, and in other computational languages, in various ways and to different
			degrees. At its core, subtyping in computational languages is about defining type hierarchies
			and the inheritance of features: mainly properties and methods in OOP; table columns and
			constraints in SQL99; elements, attributes and constraints in XML Schema.</p><p>In general, it is desirable to have support for <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">multiple classification</span></strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">multiple inheritance</span></strong></span> in type hierarchies.
			Both language features are closely related and are considered to be advanced features, which
			may not be needed in many applications or can be dealt with by using workarounds. </p><p>Multiple classification means that an object has more than one direct type. This is mainly
			the case when an object plays multiple roles at the same time, and therefore directly
			instantiates multiple classes defining these roles. Multiple inheritance is typically also
			related to role classes. For instance, a student assistant is a person playing both the role
			of a student and the role of an academic staff member, so a corresponding OOP class
				<code class="code">StudentAssistant</code> inherits from both role classes <code class="code">Student</code> and
				<code class="code">AcademicStaffMember</code>. In a similar way, in our example model above, an
				<code class="code">AmphibianVehicle</code> inherits from both role classes <code class="code">LandVehicle</code> and
				<code class="code">WaterVehicle</code>.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e6297"></a>6.1.&nbsp;Subtyping and Inheritance with OOP Classes</h3></div></div></div><p>The minimum level of support for subtyping in OOP, as provided, for instance, by Java and
				C#, allows defining inheritance of properties and methods in single-inheritance hierarchies,
				which can be inspected with the help of an <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">is-instance-of</span></strong></span> predicate that allows testing if a class is the
				direct or an indirect type of an object. In addition, it is desirable to be able to inspect
				inheritance hierarchies with the help of</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>a pre-defined instance-level property for retrieving <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">the direct type of an object</span></strong></span> (or
							its <span class="italic">direct types</span>, if multiple classification is
							allowed);</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a pre-defined type-level property for retrieving <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">the direct supertype of a type</span></strong></span> (or its
								<span class="italic">direct supertypes</span>, if multiple inheritance is
							allowed).</p></li></ol></div><p>A special case of an OOP language is JavaScript, which does not (yet) have an explicit
				language element for classes, but only for constructors. Due to its dynamic programming
				features, JavaScript allows using various code patterns for implementing classes, subtyping
				and inheritance (as we discuss in the next section on JavaScript).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="secInheritTbl"></a>6.2.&nbsp;Subtyping and Inheritance with Database Tables</h3></div></div></div><p>A standard DBMS stores information (objects) in the rows of tables, which have been
				conceived as set-theoretic relations in classical <span class="italic">relational</span> database systems. The relational database language SQL is used for
				defining, populating, updating and querying such databases. But there are also simpler data
				storage techniques that allow to store data in the form of table rows, but do not support
				SQL. In particular, key-value storage systems, such as JavaScript's Local Storage API, allow
				storing a serialization of a <span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">JSON
						table</span></strong></span> (a map of records) as the string value associated with the
				table name as a key.</p><p>While in the classical, and still dominating, version of SQL (SQL92) there is no support
				for subtyping and inheritance, this has been changed in SQL99. However, the
				subtyping-related language elements of SQL99 have only been implemented in some DBMS, for
				instance in the open source DBMS <span class="italic">PostgreSQL</span>. As a
				consequence, for making a design model that can be implemented with various frameworks using
				various SQL DBMSs (including weaker technologies such as <span class="italic">MySQL</span> and <span class="italic">SQLite</span>), we cannot use the SQL99
				features for subtyping, but have to model inheritance hierarchies in database design models
				by means of plain tables and foreign key dependencies. This mapping from class hierarchies
				to relational tables (and back) is the business of <span class="italic"><span class="bold"><strong>Object-Relational-Mapping</strong></span></span> frameworks such as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_(Java)" target="_top">Hibernate</a> (or any
				other <a class="link" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F" target="_top">JPA</a> Provider) or the <a class="link" href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html" target="_top">Active Record</a>
				approach of the <a class="link" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_top">Rails</a> framework.</p><p>There are essentially two alternative approaches how to represent a class hierarchy with
				relational tables:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html" target="_top"><span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">Single Table
									Inheritance</span></strong></span></a> is the simplest approach, where the
							entire class hierarchy is represented with a single table, containing columns for all
							attributes of the root class and of all its subclasses, and named after the name of
							the root class.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Inheritance#Joined.2C_Multiple_Table_Inheritance" target="_top"><span class="bold"><strong><span class="italic">Joined Tables
										Inheritance</span></strong></span></a> is a more logical approach, where each
							subclass is represented by a corresponding subtable connected to the supertable via
							its primary key referencing the primary key of the supertable.</p></li></ol></div><p>Notice that the <span class="italic">Single Table Inheritance</span> approach is
				closely related to the <span class="italic">Class Hierarchy Merge</span> design
				pattern discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch17s05.html" title="5.&nbsp;The Class Hierarchy Merge Design Pattern">Section&nbsp;5</a> above. Whenever this design pattern has already been
				applied in the design model, or the design model has already been re-factored according to
				this design pattern, the class hierarchies concerned (their subclasses) have been eliminated
				in the design, and consequently also in the data model to be encoded in the form of class
				definitions in the app's model layer, so there is no need anymore to map class hierarchies
				to database tables. Otherwise, when the <span class="italic">Class Hierarchy
					Merge</span> design pattern does not get applied, we would get a corresponding class
				hierarchy in the app's model layer, and we would have to map it to database tables with the
				help of the <span class="italic">Single Table Inheritance</span> approach. </p><p>We illustrate both the <span class="italic">Single Table Inheritance</span> approach
				and the <span class="italic">Joined Tables Inheritance</span> with the help of two
				simple examples. The first example is the <code class="code">Book</code> class hierarchy, which is shown
				in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#figBookClassHierarchy" title="Figure&nbsp;17.1.&nbsp;The object type Book is specialized by two subtypes: TextBook and Biography">Figure&nbsp;17.1</a> above. The
				second example is the class hierarchy of the <code class="code">Person</code> roles
				<code class="code">Employee</code>, <code class="code">Manager</code> and <code class="code">Author</code>, shown in the class
				diagram in <a class="xref" href="ch17s06.html#figPersonRoles1" title="Figure&nbsp;17.8.&nbsp;A class model with a Person roles hierarchy">Figure&nbsp;17.8</a>
				below.</p><div class="figure"><a name="figPersonRoles1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;17.8.&nbsp;A class model with a <code class="code">Person</code> roles hierarchy</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="320"><tr><td><img src="../../fig/PersonRoleHierarchy.svg" width="320" alt="A class model with a Person roles hierarchy"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e6364"></a>6.2.1.&nbsp;Single Table Inheritance</h4></div></div></div><p>Consider the single-level class hierarchy shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#figBookClassHierarchy" title="Figure&nbsp;17.1.&nbsp;The object type Book is specialized by two subtypes: TextBook and Biography">Figure&nbsp;17.1</a> above, which is an
     incomplete disjoint segmentation of the class <code class="code">Book</code>, as the design for the model
     classes of an MVC app. In such a case, whenever we have a model class hierarchy with only one
     level (or only a few levels) of subtyping and each subtype has only one (or a few) additional
     properties, it's preferable to use <span class="italic">Single Table Inheritance</span>,
     so we model a single table containing columns for all attributes such that the columns
     representing additional attributes of subclasses are optional, as shown in the SQL table model
     in <a class="xref" href="ch17s06.html#figTextBookIsaBookSingleTableInheritSqlM" title="Figure&nbsp;17.9.&nbsp;An SQL table model with a single table representing the Book class hierarchy">Figure&nbsp;17.9</a> below. </p><div class="figure"><a name="figTextBookIsaBookSingleTableInheritSqlM"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;17.9.&nbsp;An SQL table model with a single table representing the <code class="code">Book</code> class

      column</span> for representing the category of each row corresponding to the subclass
     instantiated by the represented object. Such a column would normally be string-valued, but
     constrained to one of the names of the subclasses. If the DBMS supports enumerations, it could
     also be enumeration-valued. We use the name <code class="code">category</code> for the discriminator
     column.</p><p>Based on the <code class="code">category</code> of a book, we have to enforce that if and only if it is
					"TextBook", its attribute <code class="code">subjectArea</code> has a value, and if and only if it is
					"Biography", its attribute <code class="code">about</code> has a value. This implied constraint is
					expressed in the invariant box attached to the <code class="code">Book</code> table class in the class
					diagram above, where the logical operator keyword "IFF" represents the logical equivalence
					operator "if and only if". It needs to be implemented in the database, e.g., with an SQL
					table CHECK clause or with SQL triggers.</p><p>Consider the class hierarchy shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17s06.html#figPersonRoles1" title="Figure&nbsp;17.8.&nbsp;A class model with a Person roles hierarchy">Figure&nbsp;17.8</a> above. With only three additional attributes defined
					in the subclasses <code class="code">Employee</code>, <code class="code">Manager</code> and <code class="code">Author</code>,
					this class hierarchy could again be implemented with the <span class="italic">Single
						Table Inheritance</span> approach. In the SQL table model, we can express this as
					shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17s06.html#figPersonRolesSingleTableInheritance" title="Figure&nbsp;17.10.&nbsp;An SQL table model with a single table representing the Person roles hierarchy">Figure&nbsp;17.10</a> below. </p><div class="figure"><a name="figPersonRolesSingleTableInheritance"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;17.10.&nbsp;An SQL table model with a single table representing the <code class="code">Person</code> roles

					primary key attribute(s) to be at the same time a foreign key referencing their
